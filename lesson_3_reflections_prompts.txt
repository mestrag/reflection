When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork - copies other user repositry in Github
clone - copies the repository to your local 
branch - branch is created out of the repository
